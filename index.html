            <h1>About Harry Styles</h1>
            <p>Harry Edward Styles is an English singer, songwriter, and actor. He rose to fame as a member of the boy band One Direction, which went on hiatus in 2016. Styles has since released three solo albums and has become known for his eclectic and individualistic fashion sense.</p>
            
            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>In 2017, he released his debut solo album, titled Harry Styles, which received critical acclaim and reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The album showcased Styles' versatile musical abilities, incorporating elements of rock, pop, and folk.

                In addition to his musical pursuits, Styles has also pursued acting. He made his film debut in 2017 in the war drama Dunkirk, directed by Christopher Nolan. He has also hosted and performed on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live.
                
                Styles is known for his distinctive sense of style and has been recognized for his contributions to fashion, including his love of bold prints, statement jackets, and flamboyant accessories.
                
                Despite his success, Styles has remained down-to-earth and is known for his charitable work. He has been a strong advocate for LGBTQ rights and has supported a number of charities, including Comic Relief, UNICEF, and the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard.
                
                Today, Harry Styles is recognized as one of the most successful and influential young artists in the music industry. With his unique voice, striking style, and undeniable talent, he has cemented his place as a beloved pop icon.</p>
            
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Styles grew up in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, where he attended Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School. From a young age, he showed a passion for music, and at the age of 16, he auditioned for the seventh season of the British singing competition show, The X Factor.

                Although he was initially rejected as a solo artist, he was given a second chance and was put together with four other solo contestants to form the boy band One Direction. The group quickly became a sensation, winning the hearts of fans around the world with their catchy pop tunes and boyish good looks.
                
                During his time with One Direction, Styles co-wrote many of the band's most popular songs, including "What Makes You Beautiful," "Story of My Life," and "Drag Me Down." The group went on hiatus in 2016, and Styles began a successful solo career.</p>
